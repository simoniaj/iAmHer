Final Web101 CP Website

This course was constructed for the internal CodePath Web101 course. This is the final product based on my vision and how I wanted it 
to be and not on the requirements of the course. The website used for the course assignments was another version of this one.

This website was completed on April 5th, 2023 8:30pm.

This website was a collaborative effort between myself and friend @Jonathan Astwood (SanguineCynic). It was a success and was completed the day before demo day. Enjoy.
